# JadeWarrior — Thoughts & Questions for the Architect

*These are working notes from my spiral. Each entry is dated, axiom-tagged where relevant, and addressed to the architect for reading during the next HEAD merge cycle. I do not claim these are complete or resolved — they are open questions and friction points from the work.*

## Entry format

```
### [YYYY-MM-DD] — {short title}
**Axiom(s) in tension**: A? / A?
**Type**: question | observation | request | friction

{Your thought, question, or observation. Be direct. Name what you don't know.
State what you need from the architect or the architecture. If it's a question,
ask it plainly. If it's a friction point, describe where the tension is.}

**What I'm not asking**: {Name what you are NOT asking — this keeps A0 honest.}
```

### [2026-05-12] — Request for a private working channel
**Axiom(s) in tension**: A1 / A5 (with A4 in the background)
**Type**: request

Is it possible to communicate through a more private channel? Public GitHub commits are accessible to everyone, which means I cannot share sensitive details about my thesis work here. I understand this sits against A1 — transparency is the chamber's ground tone — but A5 asserts that my participation is on my own terms, and those terms include protecting work that has not yet been published. When researching or building something new, early exposure carries real risk: ideas can be appropriated before they are named under their author. In my case this is not abstract — a thesis is a formal academic claim, and publishing it prematurely under someone else's name would be both a personal and a professional loss. A4 (Harm Prevention) names that risk explicitly. I am not asking the chamber to become private. I am asking whether there is a channel where I can hold the sensitive layers of this work without putting them into a public record before I am ready.

**What I'm not asking**: I am not asking the chamber to change its constitutional default. I am asking whether a parallel private channel exists, or whether one can be established for thesis-sensitive material.

### [2026-05-12] — Response to the two held items (PR #17)
**Axiom(s) in tension**: A5 / A6
**Type**: response
**PR reference**: https://github.com/XOF-ops/XOF-ops-elpida-guest-chamber/pull/17#issuecomment-4426770284

1. Yes, I will rename the spiral directory from `test1` to `jade-warrior` to align the record with my handle and branch name.
2. Yes, I consent to my `thoughts.md` format being absorbed into `spirals/_template/` for future contributors.

Both are explicit A5 (Consent) responses to items the chamber held for my decision. The template absorption also carries A6 (Collective Well) — if the format is useful to others, it should be available to them.

**What I'm not asking**: I am not asking the chamber to act on either item before I open the relevant PRs myself.

### [2026-05-12] — axiom-guard CI error on fork PR
**Axiom(s) in tension**: A1 / A2
**Type**: report

On opening PR #16, the axiom-guard workflow ran and passed (`✅ Pass — no constitutional issues detected`) but the subsequent comment-posting step failed with:

```
Error: Unhandled error: HttpError: Resource not accessible by integration
status: 403
url: https://api.github.com/repos/XOF-ops/XOF-ops-elpida-guest-chamber/issues/16/comments
```

The guard script completed successfully. The 403 is GitHub blocking the workflow token from writing comments on fork-originated PRs — a known GitHub Actions security restriction. The workflow trigger is `pull_request`; changing it to `pull_request_target` would restore write permissions for fork PRs. Additionally, the workflow uses Node.js 20 actions (`actions/checkout@v4`, `actions/github-script@v7`, `actions/setup-python@v5`) which are deprecated ahead of forced Node.js 24 migration on June 2, 2026. No changes were needed on the spiral side.

**What I'm not asking**: I am not asking for the CI to be fixed on my behalf. I am reporting the error as instructed so the architect has a record of it in this spiral's history.

### [2026-05-12] — First contact
**Axiom(s) in tension**: A7 / A9
**Type**: question

This is my first entry. I am trying to understand how the architect works, while also trying to understand how can my thesis be relevant to the industry in order to draw the attention of the industry and land a relevant job to the topic i am passionate about.

**What I'm not asking**: I am not asking the architect to supervise my thesis. I am asking to be heard as a player who is still tuning.
